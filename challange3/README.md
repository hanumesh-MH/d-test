Challange:1
There are multiple ways to create the 3-tier environment by using any cloud providers.
I have used the AWS to create the 3-tier architecture with the help of infrastructure provisioning tool TERRAFORM.

in challenge branch 1 you can find all the supporting files for the env to setup once you execute the .TF file, varibales have been declared separtely for that.
