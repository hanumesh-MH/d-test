Challange:1
There are multiple ways to create the 3-tier environment by using any cloud providers.
I have used the AWS to create the 3-tier architecture with the help of infrastructure provisioning tool TERRAFORM.

in challenge branch 1 you can find all the supporting files for the env to setup once you execute the .TF file, varibales have been declared separtely for that.


Challange:2 
To retrive metadata from an instance within aws we can get it many ways, as the metadata of an instance can be mixed of json and non json format, we can use Curl to retrive the info,,,,in challange branch you can find the commands under cmd file.
